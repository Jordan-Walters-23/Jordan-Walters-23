### Hi I'm Jordan 👋
I love designing and building in numerous mediums. I’ve most recently been focusing on coding in Javascript, trying different libraries and frameworks such as React and Next.js.
I've also benefited greatly from applying agile working practices to my projects. I learnt this during my time at “School of Code” and intensive coding bootcamp.

Below are some of the recent projects ive made.
