### Hi I'm Jordan üëã
I enjoy coding in Javascript, trying different libraries and frameworks such as React and Next.js. I've also benefited greatly from applying agile working practices to team and individual projects. I learnt this during my time at ‚ÄúSchool of Code‚Äù an intensive coding Bootcamp.

Alongside coding, I love designing and building in numerous mediums including electronics, clothing and mechanical assembly.

I am eager to grow as a developer and would like to work in teams developing innovative products. If you'd like to collaborate on a project, share your experience or give some advice, send me an [email](Jordanwalters681+tech@googlemail.com) or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-w-66aa96151/)
