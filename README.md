I love coding and the creative solutions that can be solved with it, I am currently using Javascript and exploring various libraries and frameworks, like React and Next.js. I have experience applying agile working practices to both team and individual projects, which I learned during my time at an Intensive 16-week coding Bootcamp called "School of Code".

In addition to coding, I enjoy designing and building in areas like electronics, and mechanical assembly. I am eager to use my skills to build Web Dev, IoT and Robotics projects. I‚Äôm looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and collaborate with teams to develop innovative products. If you're interested in working together, feel free to contact me.

# Projects
## "Guess the song" (In progress)
<b>Project summary:</b> This app idea came from my passion for language learning and music. I wanted to find a way to enjoy both in a lighthearted way that‚Äôs personalised to me. I often find myself looking up song lyrics and finding a new appreciation for the song and artist. Users will also be able to learn more diverse vocab which is beyond what they teach on most language learning apps. [App Repo](https://github.com/Jordan-Walters-23/guessthesong)

## "School of Code" Final project
<b>Project summary:</b> In a team of 6 we spent 4 weeks designing and building a full-stack application 
using Next.js, Chakra, and Supabase. We defined our problem statement, created wireframes, and took an agile approach to user and stakeholder feedback while building the app. [Click here](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/reading-room-app) to see the app's repository and how we solved our problem statement.

<b>Functionality:</b> We designed this app To help children in key stages 1 and 2 build positive reading habits with the help of a guardian or teacher. The App serves as an alternative to a paper reading record. We added an element of gamification with the avatar page because it has the potential to incentivise and make reading more enjoyable for the user.

<b>Tech stack:</b> Next.js, Chakra, Supabase, Thunder Client, and Playwright

<b>Key features:</b> 
* Homepage - Displays previous reading note
* Reading Room page - stopwatch and note-taking form features
* Avatar page - "Customise your avatar" feature


<b>Contribution:</b> I pair-programmed the page structure using Next.js and Chakra. Designed and iterated the app UI. Ensured continuity between the front and a back-end of each feature during the build and while reviewing pull requests.

<b>Documentation:</b> The following are links to documentation for our tech stack, so you can learn more about our app and even contribute if you like.
