#### Hi I'm Jordan ðŸ˜„
I love coding and the creative solutions that can be solved with it, I am currently using Javascript and exploring various libraries and frameworks, like React and Next.js. I have experience applying agile working practices to both team and individual projects, which I learned during my time at an Intensive coding Bootcamp called "School of Code".

In addition to coding, I enjoy designing and building in areas like electronics, clothing, and mechanical assembly. I am eager to use my skills to build Web Dev, IoT and Robotics projects. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and collaborate with teams to develop innovative products. If you're interested in working together, feel free to contact me through [email](Jordanwalters681+tech@googlemail.com) or [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-w-66aa96151/)

Below are some of the recent projects I've made.

# Projects
### "School of Code" Final project <br>
Project summary: In a team of 6 we spent 4 weeks designing and building a full-stack application 
using Next.js, Chakra, and Supabase. We defined our problem statement, created wireframes, and took an agile approach to user and stakeholder feedback.
