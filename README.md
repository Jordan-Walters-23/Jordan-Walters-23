#### Hi I'm Jordan ðŸ˜„
I love coding and the creative solutions that can be solved with it, I am currently using Javascript and exploring various libraries and frameworks, like React and Next.js. I have experience applying agile working practices to both team and individual projects, which I learned during my time at an Intensive coding Bootcamp "School of Code".

Alongside coding, I love designing and building in numerous mediums including electronics, clothing and mechanical assembly.

I am eager to grow as a developer and would like to work in teams developing innovative products. If you'd like to collaborate on a project, share your experience or give some advice, send me an [email](Jordanwalters681+tech@googlemail.com) or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-w-66aa96151/) 

Below are some of the recent projects I've made.

# Projects
### "School of Code" Final project <br>
Project summary: In a team of 6 we spent 4 weeks designing and building a full-stack application 
using Next.js, Chakra, and Supabase. We defined our problem statement, created wireframes, and took an agile approach to user and stakeholder feedback.
